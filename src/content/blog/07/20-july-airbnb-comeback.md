## Your property

Your living area is spacious, bright, uncluttered and high-ceilinged. It's sun-filled by day and bright far into the night during summer.

"Smidig," (11) a Main Coon cat, will share the space with you, and you may give her food once a day. Or we will feed her.

There is a functional but unfinished kitchen and a few other unfinished surfaces as we remodel between stays.

You'll have a small, soulful courtyard surrounded by a tall wall and our wee, white-wood home. Use the courtyard for drinks, take-out meals, or barbeque.

The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower.
