Listing description
Enjoy Oslo's coziest downtown neighborhood from a spacious studio. Relax in perfect privacy after you've experienced the full Oslo adventure at a leisurely walk. See "Other details to note" for a taste of recommended stops on your walk.

You'll have a small, soulful courtyard surrounded by a tall wall and our wee, white wood home. Use the courtyard for drinks, eating take out or barbeque.

Your property
Share a general description of your property's rooms and spaces so guests know what to expect

Your living area is spacious, bright, uncluttered and high-ceilinged. It's sun-filled by day, but also bright far into the night. We will provide you with sleeping masks.

There is a functional but unfinished kitchen and a few other unfished surfaces as we remodel between stays.

The bathroom has bathtub and a shower.

The washing area has a washing machine and a dryer and a steam iron.

Guest access
You'll have access to the entire ground floor. However, there is a mezzanine floor that is mostly used for storage that is is off limits for guests.


Interaction with guests
We live in a sperate unit on the same property that shares the courtyard. So you'll see us around. Or just knock on the door. We work from home so we'll probably be there. :-)

Other details to note
An old Main Coon cat will share the space with you, and you'll need to give her food once a day. Or we will feed her, her name is "Smidig".
