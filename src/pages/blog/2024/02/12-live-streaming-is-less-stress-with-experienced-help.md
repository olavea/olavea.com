# Live streaming is less stress with an experienced dev to help

## Are your devs STUCK with their blog-posting? 🤔

Writing a useful technical blog-post is surprisingly hard, especially if you only write a handful each year.

## Imagine your devs publishing REGULARLY & with a visible smile
almost without bad feelings

## A live stream is less stress & less work than a blog-post 😃

if your devs get helped with EVERYTHING by a more experienced dev they trust.

## YOUR dev only has to show up on the live stream, if you let MY team do the rest 👩‍🏫


## Let MY team do all the "hard" stuff so that YOUR dev only has to show up and talk to me about everyday work stuff while I live code on with YOUR tool.
