# Child mind and mistakes are skill-building tools

Mistakes are a powerful skill-building tool, but not if you cling to a closed mindset. Because:

1. A closed mindset will prevent you from making ENOUGH mistakes in the first place. You stop yourself from attempting to do a thing because your not good enough at it. Because you don't feel like making mistakes. But DOING stuff you're "not good ENOUGH at" is the corner stone of skill-building.

## My fifth vlogging mistake

I'll use myself as an example. I made a 50 second video and posted it to youtube. You can see me holding up cards with writing on them, but you probably won't be able to read my cards, because I'm filming in selfie mode. It's like looking in a bathroom mirror. So the writing is ... mirrored.

Here is one of the cards in my video:

I made a mistake, good for me. So what? Shortly after seeing my mistake, I got an idea for solving the problem. Writing mirrored in the first place:

So what?

## Your brain is sensitive to making mistakes

If you haven't noticed, your brain is sensitive to making mistakes. Which means, solving your problem AFTER making a mistake, makes your solution stick THAT much longer and harder in your brain. You are building a skill. If I had read about the solution in the "vlogging docs" the impact in my brain would have been weaker.
