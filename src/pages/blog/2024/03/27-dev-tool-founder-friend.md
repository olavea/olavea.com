Ahoy  !
ü•≥üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

You were an absolute treasure as a guest on our Pirate Live Coding Show back in the good old days.

I hope you and the goats are doing well. I also hope it's okay to ask you for help. Please help us tell the right founder about our Newest & Shiniest service.

We announce our private beta through devs like you. You who's been a guest on our live show and knows the show is a wild ride, but still mostly harmless.

Would you think about the founders you know of? We're looking for a decent dev-tool founder. A founder who is a dev and don't have a dev-rel to make videos.

"Go Live with Queen Raae" is the name of our new service.

Queen Raae will be live coding just like in the good old times. What's new is, after we'll chop the show up into a bunch of video clips for Twitter and the like.

I'd consider it a fine favor if you introduced Queen Raae to that founder you thought about. Or maybe a fitting founder didn't pop into your head? Forget about it! I'll just ask you something else, some other time.


It's okay to say "no", but if you found a founder, send me a "yes" or a üëç. I'll send you a short email about how we usually do introductions. Spoiler alert: it's mostly copy / paste.

Safe sailing! ‚õµ

're not too uncomfortable about the introduction I'll send you an email template.


Send me a "yes" or a üëç. I'll send you an email you can copy / paste and send to both your friend and Queen Raae. So they can chat about video marketing to devs.
