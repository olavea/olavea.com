# A writing process, you have one dev!

Even if you don't see it, you have a writing process. I'll show you. üëÅÔ∏è


## Write down your writing process üîß

If you love tools, like I do, you should write down your writing process. Because a written down writing process is a tool. üîß I'll show you how to do it.

But first the "what, why and how" of your writing process.


## The short version: "what, why and how" of your writing process

**What:** a written down writing process

**Why:** the same reasons you write

**How:** hold my beer üç∫


## A more detailed version: "what, why and how" of your writing process

**What:**

Some steps written down about how you ACTUALLY write yourself all the way from idea to "done"

**Why:**

Why DO you write anyway? I know you have at least ONE reason to write, or else you wouldn't do it. Because writing is a piraty pain. ü§Æ Yeah I said it!

Knowing your real reason for writing is not a bad idea, so bonus points for writing down some ideas. üí°üí° My reason for writing is **"giving back to the dev community who helped me learn to code"**.

**How:**

Write down your writing process

- Set a timer for 22 minutes ‚è≤Ô∏è
- Go back in time to the last piece of writing you finished ‚õµ
- Write down any idea for steps you took along the way towards "done" üìñ
- Now re-write your steps in order, from "start" to "done"
- Add in steps you've taken in your past writing, that you skipped this last time
- That's it! ü•≥

## The secret hidden in your writing process

Here's a writing secret for you: the MOST important step in your writing process is the getting to "done" step. Sounds obvious you say? But does it show in the way you prioritize your writing? No matter how well you've worked on your other writing process steps, if you don't push your writing piece all the way to "done", you've betrayed every dev who might have benefitted from your insight!

## Make more headspace, ship it already! ‚õµ

I've added one step to my writing process to help me make it all the way to "done". What is that step? I ship my unreadable draft.

For example I ship my filthy first-draft blog-posts.

## How does publishing a bad blog-post help my writing?

- Firstly, because the bad blog-post is now out there embarrasing me. Nobody's going to read it ... probably. But my brain doesn't trust that.
- Secondly and more importantly, because shipping that bad blog-post frees up space in my head. I get more headspace for more ideas.


Here's a tale. I'm in my kitchen in the morning. The girls are still sleeping. I'm All alone, just myself and the sweet smell of freshly brewed coffee. I get an idea for the draft I shipped on writing process. My idea is, "done is the most important step in your writing process". That clarity helps me cut a few paragraphs. And knowing what point I'm REALLY making about the writing process motivates me to write it all the way to "done".
