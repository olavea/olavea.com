🎸 I'm NOT my website's user because ... mindset 🧠

🧠 My user's mindset is NOT at all like my mindset, that's why I made this persona: "The New Jr. Dev". And what's my next step? Do I need to do user-testing or interviews or something? We'll see....

Inspiration came from Thiago Esser's sketchNote "You're not your user", check him out on twitter https://twitter.com/thiagoesser

🧠 My user's mindset is NOT at all like my mindset, my user just wants to "get it OVER with" and move on to the next task. That's why I made this persona:

"Tech Lead"

"get it OVER with"
