Ahoy swashbuckling Shipmate!

A Piraaaaty Neeew Yeeear to YOU! 🏴‍☠️🥳🚀
And welcome aboard our original new email series. ⛵

You'll get:
- links to writings we find on our thrilling treasure hunts for the loot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and
- a log of our piraty dev-life in three areas:

1 Piraty dev-life at work 🔧
2 Piraty dev-life at home and 🏠
3 Piraty dev-life at play 💃

Our new year's resolution is to **make our dev-life more Piraty at play** 💃 . We've already started. You can [read how the Pirate Princess and Cap'n Ola Vea hacked a minimal viable christmas tree](https://www.olavea.com/blog/2024/01/01-hacking-around-the-christmas-tree-its-a-hacky-holidaaay/). 🎄🔧

We polished off a playful holiday by filling our house with a piraty party. Soon we'll have an even more prodigious party for Queen Raae's birthday. 🥳

We'd LOVE to hear your new year's resolution, so write it in your reply if you dare. 👻
