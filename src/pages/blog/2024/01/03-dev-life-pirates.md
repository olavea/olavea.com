## The Dev-life Pirates Podcast

**What is it:** A podcast to show: your dev-life can also be a PIRATE'S-life! 🥳🏴‍☠️

**What is it for:** inspiration to live life more piraty (= more your way).

**Who is it for:** devs who want to make the most of their dev-life, You know treasure hunters.

P.S.

## Voluntary Preparation

If you'd like to prep, you can choose what area of Dev-Life we'll focus on in our conversation. A focus on one area will help us dive deeper down with our conversation. I'm one of those devs who believe "the deeper you dive the better the treasure hunting".

## So what area of Dev-Life would you like to focus on:

1. dev-life at work 🔧
2. dev-life at home 🏠
3. dev-life at play ⛵
4. Another dev-life area of your choosing 🥳
