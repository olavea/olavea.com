**What:** christmas tree

**How:** did the Pirate Princess and Cap'n Ola Vea get a minimal viable christmas tree going?
Yeah we started out making a plan, gathering tools and rounding up the team.

**Why:**

## The team was

- Lillian Raae-Vea (8 🏴‍☠️👸) &
- Ola Vea (dev-dad)

You've heard people say about building an app, you start by making a skateboard 🛹, not the car wheel 🏎️. So Lillian got the idea to use her skateboard as a sort of cart to drag the christmas tree on.


## Our tools list 🔧

- skateboard 🛹
- several ropes 🧶
- mobile phone, for payment ☎️
- and last, but not least duct tape. 💪

## Our plan 🗺️

1. Go down to the park 🌳🌳
2. Find a decent christmas tree 🌲
3. Pay for said christmas tree 💲
4. Drag the christmas tree home, on the skateboard 🛹
5. Put stuff on the christmas tree 🌟
6. Dance around the christmas tree singing loudly with family and friends 🎵

## The photographic evidence

Here The Pirate Princess and Cap'n Ola Vea buys 💲 the christmas tree from nobody, but a piece of paper. 📄

The Pirate Princess and Cap'n Ola Vea draggs the christmas tree home on the skateboard. 🛹 Singing christmas songs slightly too loud and slightly off key. 🔑🎵

Back home we sawed off a slice of the christmas tree trunk, as per recipe. 🪓 Making sure the saw dust ended up outside.

Queen Raae had dug out the christmas tree foot for us. So we put the christmas tree in it's foot and watered it. 🌊

Lillian took off the tree's red stocking with scissors. ✂️

Then we removed all the stuff that was in the christmas tree's corner including mommo's old treasure chest. 🗃️

We have some old christmas tree lights and when Queen Raae joined us we twirled those christmas tree lights onto the tree. 🚦

Stuck the christmas tree lights in the electrical socket and they lit up. For five seconds, blinked a few times and shut themselves off. 🚨

A closer look at the electrical cabel showed it to be almost completely worn in two. The pirate Princess and Queen Raae kept on dressing up the christmas tree,


## Hacking the christmas tree lights

I sat down with an old scout's knife. 🔪 Old, but sharp as a tack. 🌮 And I wittled off the plastic thing that is closest to where the cable joins the electrical socket. 🔌 And then I tied the copper bits back together. Then I secured the whole thing with duct tape.


## Family and friends came and we danced around the christmas tree

"Uncle" Allister our Captain during the summer and my training buddy the rest of the year.
