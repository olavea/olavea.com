Hallå!
Hal her.
Helten i sjørøverhistorien min er ikke meg, men sjefen min Lotta.

En sjørøverhistorie skal egentlig en en start. Sorry, men jeg må fortelle deg i dag, fordi ... du får se sjøl.

For lenge siden, på ei bru langt, langt borte ....

A long time ago

on a bridge

far, far

away ....

Only in nightmares

had Hal ever been so

squashed, hemmed, pressed

by other people. It is

like a nightmare

here on our bridge.

The singing,

the clapping

the crush, the joy

and confusion.

A nightmare

In which  ...

and had ...

and ...

Hal is used to the

busteling London Bridge

The ...

The ...

Only yesterday Hal had

thought it could get no

busier. Now he has

people on every side,

pushing, jostling,

singing. Hundreds

of them. Maybe thousands!

Faces loomes up

and flashes by

smiling, laughing,

drunken. Gone in

a dizzing whirl

of colour. Hal

swallows, blinks,

his head spins.

Surely this IS

a nightmare.

«Move!» A shoulder

knocks Hal roughly

aside and is gone.

Hal leans against a

bright white wall and

wipes sweat from his face.

Hal gets moving,

mustn't loose

sneaky Sneako.

Hal had spotted

Sneako the second

he snook onto our

Bridge. Is Sneako

Lucy's kidnapper?

Hal tails Sneako

to find out.

Sneako certainly

looks Sneaky.

Hal trades places

with Lotta to not

be noticed.

Lotta dances and slides

through the busteling

crowds.

«Sausage-inna-bun!

Real beef. Hot

sausage-inna-bun!»


«Drums! Tambourins!»

«You see him ahead?»

Whispers Lotta.

«Aye, bearly. Let's

speed up.» Whispers Hal.

«No mustn't get too

close. Or he'll see

us tailing him. Stop.»

Whispers Lotta.

They hide inside a

parrot stall.

«Ahoy Hal. Out

stalking again» Whispers

Parrot-Paulie.

«Good day to you

Parrot-Paulie. See

you later at

the concert.» Whispers

Whispers Hal.

«Mieouw-

Miiieoooouuuw!»

«Oi! Lotta take

over the tail

I gotta get down

this kitty.» Hal

whispers.

«I already HAVE

his tail and don't

dawdle he might BE

Lucy's kidnapper.»

Lotta hisses back.

Hal climbs up in no

time. «I've saved

kitties from here

before. You'll be

safe inside my jerkin,

but where's our Ratface

gone to?» Hal has a good

view of the street ahead,

all the way past

their own house.

Hal climbs quikly

down and sprints

to Lotta.

«Gone?»

«Yeah. Gone inside

a house maybe?»

«Drat! I'll check

our house.» Hal

whispers.

«Oh yeah, forgot

to lock our door

again?» Lotta

whispers.

«Did NOT.» Hal

whispers.

«Did TOO.» Lotta

whispers.

«Nope.» Hal

whispers.

«Well the door IS

open ...» Lotta

whispers.

They sneak inside,

Hal hand signals

for each of them

to go in through

a kitchen door.

«ALARM! THIEF!»  Hal

hollers towards the

open door, knowing

his voice will carry

outside. Ratface

whirls to face Hal.

«Hah! You boy! You

and me.»

«Others will come

Ratface, The

neighbourhood watch.»

Ratface smiles,

yellow teeth and

a clawlike blade

glints in his left

hand. The kitten rears

it's orange head hissing

at Ratface who stumbles

a step back and goes

down right over Lotta's

leg sweep. Lotta grips

Ratface's knifehand in both

of hers and slams the

back of her knee on his

face. Creates a vice around

Ratface's neck and arm

with her other leg.

«GAH!» Ratface drops

his curved knife with

a tinkle.


«I yield. I yield. AAAH!»

Hal sees the

neighbourhood watch

Mrs ... and Mrs ...

and Mrs Luhan the muscular

wife of the smith.

Mrs Luhan gives a "don't

stop for us" wave.

«AAAA!» Screams Ratface

«Who sent you?» Lotta's

voice is low and menancing.

«I'll say nuffink!» Shouts

Ratface.

«I'll show you nothing.

You think THIS hurts.

this is nothing! Here

it comes.» Says Lotta

with a smile.

«GAAAH! NOOOO! MUH!

Murdred. It was

Murdred sent me.»

Shouts Ratface.

«NO way. No ugly rat

like you work for

Murdred. He's lads

are all pretty as

girls.» Lotta keeps

squeezing.

«I'm freelance.»

Ratface whispers

out of breath his

face contorts in pain.

«Let him go now,

Werlin's concert

is about to start.»

Says Hal, but too

late. Ratface's

eyes rolls up and

he goes limp. Lotta

let's him go.

«Neat, you put him

to sleep.» Mrs Luhan

looks impressed.

«He bored me.» Says

Lotta.

«Murdred Huh?! What

if it's true? Can't

get worse than that.»

Says Hal.

«Yeah you two best

leave town for a while.»

Says Mrs Luhan.

Ratface is up taking

a running jump

through the kitchen

window with a chrash

and a cheer from the

crowd outside.

«Drat, I guess he had

some secrets still

in him. Oh hello

Werlin.» Says Hal.

«Hello again my

beauties! Is it

happening? Are you

feeling it?!» Says Werlin

with a huge smile under

his big, black mustach.

«Listen. Haven't I

told you to listen

deeply. How can you listen

deeply when you rudely

choke the man out? HMMM!»

Says Werlin.

Lotta looks at the

floor.

«Monstrous Murdred Huh?!

My, my, my. Murdred and

his merry mob of

malignants. You two.

You best listen this

time or it'll be too

late. If Murdred and

his witch hunters gets

a shred of evidence

aginst you, your DONE.

Instead you'd better

be GONE. Leave. Now

I gotta leave for

my concert. See you

after in your rooftop

hut. I'll get you

out of here.»

«Knock. BANG. Knock.»

«What now?»

«Oh, hello ... What's up?»


Hal comes to the door

and sees the Lucas

from two houses down

the street.

«Our Lucy sent us

a letter.»

Says mr Luca.

«That's good.»

Says Hal. Mrs

Luca sits down

on the floor,

bawling her eyes out.

«Look, there's

another letter

attached.» Says

mr Luca and

Hal reaches

for it.

«Hal! Put the

kettle on, that's

a dear.» Lotta says,

Hal rubs some people

the wrong way

sometimes, like now.

## The Ransom Note

Wanna see

Yer gurl?

Give us the

Treasure Map'o

Web-Dev

islands.

Best wishes X.

«Why'd the Lucas come to

Hal & Lotta

with that

ransom note?»

You ask. They are

Detectives Hal & Lotta,

Pirate Detectives.

Their neighbours bring

them cases.

Hal feeds the Lucas ginger

cookies and they tell

how Lucy went out to

do a morning delivery of

chocolate croissants,

never to be seen again.

Hal writes down the

address of the chocolate

croissant customer. It

WAS near Southie. But

Hal says nothing about

THAT as tea cups empties.

«Leave it with us.» Hal

says to the Lucas.

«We'll find this

Treasure Map of

these so-called

'Web-Dev Islands'

and we'll set up

an exchange with

this "X", don't

you worry.»

«YESS! We've got

a new case!» Says Hal

when they are alone.

«And a tough one.»

Lotta says thoughtfully

tapping her pointy my

tooth.

«So what's our next

move?» Says Lotta.

«You ever heard of

these Web-Dev Islands?»

Hal says.

«No, but the whole PLACE

sounds insanely illegal,

so it's not strange I

haven't heard of them.»

Says Lotta.

An explosion of roars

and wild clapping from

outside.

«We can't leve now,

we finally got our

first clue in the

Lucy case.»

«If Murdred gets us

locked up in the Tower

there's not much we

can do to find Lucy.»

«Yeah, that's another

thing. We can't leave

now. That's like

CONFESSING we're guilty

of whatever Murdred is

trying to get us for.»

«Yeah confession, Murdred

favourite thing.»

«And thirdly, sir Ector will

spank us if we leave his

house and his secrets

when we promised to

protect all of it.»

«Bang. BANG-BANG-BANG bang bang!»

Hal opens and:

«AH! Good thing you

children are home,

cause your staying

for a while. Here's

a warrant for your

house arrest. For

choking a mr Green

unconcious. The poor

innocent man is with

the surgeon as we speak.»

Says a sing-song-voice.

«Murdred.» Says Lotta.

«Werrreechz!» Sneers

the orange cat.

«Yuck! I hate cat

monsters.» Murdred struts

around with Werlin singing

outside the open door.

«Close that door,

the noise irks me.»

One of Says Murdred's

twelve thugs slams

the door.

«Sir Ector isn't home

yet eh? Any of you

traitors going to talk?»

Sneers Says Murdred.

«He'd send you packing

in no time.» Says Lotta.

Murdred picks up kitchen

items and drops them on

the floor.

«Well I've got an

anonymous tip you two

have been experimenting

treasonously with

web-dev witchcraft.

It's true isn't it?»

Says Murdred.

«No.» Says Hal.

«Ah. So says every

traitor. But if I

find evidence, it's

YOU Sir Ector will

send packing.» Says

Murdred.

«We're Loyal to

Our Queen.» Says Hal.

«So you say. So you

SAY. HO-HO-HO who's

been a bad kid!? I spy

with my eye a banned

book.» Murdred stretches

up tp the top shelf of the

kitchen bookcase and pulls

out a blue book. Swings it

in a wide arch, piruetting

like a dancer.

«JavaScript for Kids!

TRRRREASOOOON! MO-HA-

HA-HA! Write it down

notary.» Says Murdred.

The notary scribbles

furiously on his parchment

a pink tip of tounge sticks

out.

The orange kitten bites Hals

hand and flies at Murdred's

face, hugging it like a killer

kraken. Murdred stumbles

backwards clutching the

blue book to his chest.

His thugs backs off in

horror. Smiling Lotta dances

forward snaps the blue book.

«Run Forrest. RUUUN!» Lotta

shouts. Hal sprints up the

stairs. Lotta lifts the kitten

by the scruff of it's neck

and lifts it towards the

thugs. One thug opens

the outer door and they

all back off.

«Iiiin the lap of the

Gods!» Werlin sings outside.

Lotta takes a step closer.

«BOOO!» Shouts Lotta.

All the thugs run out.

Lotta walks calmly up

the stairs lika straight

gangster.

«Yooouuuu'll regreeet

thiiis!» Murdred's sing-

song-voice has a catch

in it.

«And you sound like a

little lass.» Lotta says

over her shoulder.

Hal has a wild look in

his eyes.

«You wanna stay? In house

arrest? Like a law abiding

citizen?» Says Lotta.

«We can't go. We need to

protect Sir Ector's house.»

Says Hal.

«Oh yeah! You smell that?

Smoke.

Murdred has put fire to our

house. That's his way when

he finds no proof. You know

it.» Says Lotta.

«We can put out the fire.»

«Nobody puts out Murdred's

fires. He always brings

cartloads of house burning

materials.» Says Lotta.

They climb the top secret

ladder to the rooftop.

«That's We Are the Champions,

it's Werlin's second to

last song.» Says Hal.

«Good thing I packed for

both of us, I see you've

packed nothing.» Says Lotta.

«I'm not going, I'm staying.

Ah hey Werlin! You're

already here!»

«Friends! Friends! I saw

Murdred roll up two wagons,

so I made my drummer sing

the last song.» Says Werlin.

«I'm not going, I need to

find Lucy.»

«I've got a tip for you,

The Merry Mermaid Pub

is the best place to

hear tales of treasure

maps.» Says Werlin.

«The Merry Mermaid?

Never heard of that

pub.» Says Hal.

«I'll show you the way,

if you decide to go.»

Says Werlin.

«You'll show us a place

were we might find the

treasure map of the

Web-Dev Islands?» Says Hal.

«Yes and SO much more,

you've never seen before!»

Says Werlin.

«But what about sir

Ectors house?» Says Hal.

«You'll build a new

one with all that

treasure you'll find.»

Says Werlin.

«Yeah I'm ready for

a treasure hunt!» Hal

climbs into the yellow

and pink climbing ship

he built with Lotta

when he was younger.

«Oi! This is new!

'Break Glass In Case

of Treasure Hunt'»

Hal breaks glass.

«That looks like

a sword hilt!» Says

Lotta.

«Yeah it's an early

birthday gift.» Says

Werlin.

«Now what?» Says Hal.

«Now sweet Hal you

pull the handle labeled

'Request'.» Says Werlin.

«Wait Hal, it's labeled

'Request (Do NOT pull

in case of fire)'» Says

Lotta.

«We've not a moment to

loose then, before the

fire reach us.» Says Hal.

«What does it do? WAIT!

HAL!» Shouts Lotta as

Hal pulls the 'Request'

lever.

«Yoouuuu'll seeeee!»

Shouts Werlin.

Like a loose tooth

coming out the whole

climbing ship lurches

loose and slides down

the sloping roof. A big,

black square opens in

the roof a bit further

down. They slide into

the darkness. And hit

sloshing water. Werlin

sings a wild wordless

melody at the top of

his voice. The darkness

turns red, then yellow,

orange. They're sloping

downwards. Faster back

to red. Yellow, orange.

Red. Yellow, orange.

Red. Yellow, orange.

Hal sees a black drop

ahead.

«On three you breath in!

On one you hold your

noses!» Werlin Shouts

over the splashing.

Hal wedges himself

with his butt into

a corner and his

legs to the wall.

Clutching the orange

cat, who is calm for

some reason.

Yellow, orange. red.

They shoot over the

edge without leaving

the water. Yellow, orange.

Red. Faster, faster. Down

ahead Hal sees a yellow,

orange and red cavern

zooming towards him.

Growing.

«Three!» Shouts Werlin.

Hal breaths in deeply.

He's soaked now.

«Two-ONE!» Shouts Werlin.

Hal holds his nose and

hides the cat's face

on his chest. They shoot

up the side of the cavern,

slows at the top and speed

down. They hit in an

explosion of white water,

filling the climbing ship.

Slows down. Slides towards

a gaping boy in a black

bicorn hat. Eyes big and round.

They slide to a stop at an

old grey wooden pier.

The boy fumbles at his

belt and clumsily pulls

a rusty cutlass.

«S-s-s-stop! Please.

I mean, ALARM Aliens!»

Shouts the boy.

«No need for THAT lad,

we come in peace. Take

us to your larder.»

Says Werlin smiling warmly.

«I know how to use this!

Don't come closer.» Shouts

the boy with a scared voice.

«Not another of your pranks

Cisco, you woke me with

your splashing ruckus.

Oh MY! MY Oh MY!» A fat

little man stares at them.

«Where are your manners man.

You're supposed to toast

our safe landing in your

best rum.» Says Werlin

the closest Hal has

ever heard him to angry.

«Uhm-Ah ... awfully sorry

sir. I ... I'll get the

glasses in a jiffy. Cisco!

Put up that old cutlass,

do they look like aliens

to you?!» says the fat

little man and shuffles

of around the corner.

«Well ... Yes. Actually.»

Says the boy.

Hal steps onto the pier

and holds out his cat

towards the boy.

«Wanna hold her? Don't

be scared her name is

Jenny» Says Hal.

«It's a boy-cat.» Says

Lotta and walks past

the boy to stroke a

stack of pink towels,

printed with lettering,

neatly folded on a chair.

«It's a girl.» Says Hal

looking at his cat.

«Pretend to drink

the rum.» Whispers Werlin

out the side of his mouth.

«Here's the rum sir. Sorry

about our clumsiness.»

The man pours five tiny

glasses from a small,

brown barrel in the

crook of his arm. He

toasts with Werlin.

Lotta passes her glass

to the boy behind the

mans back.

«Thank you and have a

peacful watch.» Werlin says

and walks off toweling his

head with one of the

printed, pink towels.

«Uh ... Yeah, peacful.

Right. Off course.»

Mumbles the man.

«To the Merry

Mermaid then.» Says Hal.

«Yes. Welcome to

Drown Town.» Says Werlin

with his arms outstretch

and showing his crooked

teeth in a grand smile.

«You'll never find a

more wretched hive of

piracy and tall tales.

We must listen deeply

for clues.»

Inside the Merry Mermaid

«Hey! We don't serve

their kind here.» The

bartender points angrily

at Hal's cat.

«WHAT?!» Says Hal.

«Your feline! He'll have

to wait outside, we don't

want him here.» The bartender ...

«It's a girl!» Says Hal,

but he finds a little hut

outside with water. Coming

inside again he bumps

into a hard shoulder

in the dim light.

«He doesn't like you.»

Says a scarred face.

«I'm sorry.» Says Hal.

«You watch yourself.

I have hanging sentences

on twelve islands.» Says

scar face.

«I'll be carful then.»

Says Hal.

«You'll be dead!» Says

scar face.

«YOU'll be dead!»

Says Lotta pointing

the sailors own

pistols at them.

«I'll give you a bullet

or a grog. Which will

it be? Bullet or grog?!»

Says Lotta calmly.

«I'll take the grog.»

The quiet sailor says.

«Keep your scarred buddy

away from me or he'll

start leaking.» Says

Lotta handing the sailor

two grogs from the bar.

«Yes miss. Thanks miss.

Bye miss.» Says the

quiet sailor.

«Humph!» Says Lotta and

drags Hal deeper into

the noisy Mermaid. A

big beardy sailor points

them to the roaring fireplce

all the way in the back,

behind a bunch of actors

they see Werlin handing

out grogs from a tray

to a score of scruffy

sailors. Saying "sailors"

is not precise, proper pirates

is what they look like.

Werling gave Lotta an

Hal his 'shut-up-&-listen'

look. A rock hard

red head rapped her

now empty grog on

the table top and

looked around the group

with half lidded eyes.

«Web-Dev Islands? Yeeeeah.

That's where Cap'n Crook

dug his treasure down.

Innit!?» Says the red head

and pulls a thumb-sized

wad of chewing tobacco

out of her jaw.

«Yall heard the one

about ol' Cap'n Crook?

How he aaalmooost lost

both his hands? Hmm?»

Says the red head.

«Noooo!» Shouts a

chorus of coarse voices.

Some banging on the table.

Both Hal and Lotta had heard

THAT terrible tale. But

Werlin watched them so

they listened in silence.

«He wasnae old back then, our

Cap'n Crook. Was he a

Captain?» Says the red head.

«Noooo!» Shouts are eager

now. She smiles wolfishly

and downs a grog she got

handed.

«A beardless cute, cook boy

and his name wasnae even

Crook! Mo-Ha-Ha-HA!» They all

join in the infectious laughter.

«We were boarding a frog

in the Biscay. A fair french

frigate. Blessedly legit,

mind you. We HAD the proper

paper work. The Kings writ

with red wax on it. Those

were the days my friends!»

Shouts the red head holding

her cup out while a

peg-legged pirate pours

grog sloppily.

«Horray! More Grog!

To the King! Down

with all frogs!» Shouts the

pirates and Werlin pours.

«Aye, the bad, big Biscay.

The sun hid behind a

cloud blazingly fast

and a wind came up from

nowhere. Slapping our

ship around. Next thing our

Captain is down in the drink.

Captain Pan hisself, out cold.

Floating around. Helpless as

a babe in a Bahamas jungle.»

The red head emptied her grog

and held it out. And kept talking.

«Lil' cook boy Crook

dived down and a white

shark surfaced straight

away. The boy punched

the shark straight on

the snout. And a surprised

shark it was. That shark

gave our boy the a sulky

stare. Our boy didn't blink,

he stared straight back.

Holding his guard up lika pro.

And we got a line around

Captain Pan and hoisted him

outta the drink. He always was

a wee fairy-like thing our

Captain Pan. So we hoisted

him way to fast and hard.

Flew up he did. Booped his

head on the yardarm. We

booped him back to wakefulness.

Not a bit blissful about being

booped. The most creative

cursing I've heard before

or since. Aye our Captain

Pan had a piraty mouth

when he was cross.

Cook boy Crook looked up,

open mouthed. And THAT

was when a colossal

crocodile clamped it's

chops onto BOTH of Crooks

hands. Crook pulled the ONE

hand unstuck. Grabbed and

ripped the other arm loose.

We hoisted Crook up.

He lay down on deck.

With his arm aloft, held

by his other hand. Where

was his hand?»

«GOOONE!» Shouts the pirates.

«Datsright! GONE baby gone.

Blood was spraying up

in spurts and what did

Crook saaaay?»

«Pardon me for laying down.»

Shouts the pirates.

«Datsright. Always polite

was Crook. 'That swim

took the wind outta my

sails.' he said. Pan

was grateful for

Crook guarding him

from the shark and

paying with his paw.

So on his deathbed Captain

Pan gave Crook a map.

A treasure map of the

Dead-Dev Islands. Or the

Web-Dev Islands as

people call them nowadays.

And THAT folks is how

it REALLY happened.»

## Våre savnede småjenter

Det er ikke bare fest og moro på brua vår. Sør for oss ligger Southie.


![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAbWoMlWcAAtWBK?format=jpg&name=small)

Og denne ene våren har 2 småjenter blitt borte fra brua vår.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAbWoMlWcAAtWBK?format=jpg&name=small)


Ryktet på brua er at småjentene våre 💙 blei kidnappa av slemminger fra Southie. 💀


![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAf9LSLWMAAh-nW?format=jpg&name=small)

Nattevaktene har ikke patruljert inn i Southie på 12 år.

Lotta & Hal våkna av hamring på døra.


«Ah, det er DERE.»
Hal slapp inn herr of fru Black fra to hus bortafor.

«Vår Lucy sendte oss et brev.»
Sa herr Black.
«Det er jo bra.» Sa Hal fru Black satt seg på gølvet og hylgrein.

«Se her er et vedlagt enda et brev.» Sa herr Black og Hal strakk seg etter brevet.

«Hal.» Ropte Lotta «Sett over tevannet, er du snill.»

Lotta synes jeg ... , som nå.

( Lotta thinks I rub some
people the wrong way sometimes, like now. )

«Hvorfor kom herr og fru Black til Lotta & Hal med det utpressingsbrevet?» Spør du.

«So what's

Said Hal.
«Have you

«Yeah .... Let's go have some egg & bacon breakfast down at the Dolphin and see what gossip we can pick up about these 'Web-Dev Islands'.» I said

So Hal and I popped into the Dodgy Dolphin for a spot of breakfast. As always there was a loud group of musicians and actors drinking at the bar. We ignored them and went to the fireplace. A handfull of sailors were sitting close to the roaring fire. I say "sailors", but they were proper pirates. We knew them from the "Tarquin Todd case" last summer.

Hal & I brought the pirates a round of grog and a piece of paper with my sketchnoted Web-Dev Islands Treasure Map. Hal & I ate our bacon'n eggs in silence. It's a mistake to ask a question off of a pirate, she'll clam up. But shut up yourself and a pirate will start chatting like a magpie. Can't help herself. Silence is torture to a pirate. Uncle Walsingham told us that.

A hard looking redhead slammed her empty grog on the table.

«Yall heard the one about how ol'Cap'n Crook aaaalmost lost BOTH his hands?» She whispered huskily and pulled a great wad of chewing tobacco out of her upper jaw. I've heard several versions, but I wasn't worried because the tales were all GREAT.

«He wasnae old back then our Cap'n Crook. A beardless cook boy he was. We were boarding a french frigate in the Biscay. Totally legit mind you, we HAD the paperwork. The weather turned treacherous, slapping our ship around. Next thing Captain Pan hisself was down in the drink. Captain Pan floating around unconscious, helpless as a babe in a Bahamas jungle! Young Crook jumped right in after. And wouldn't you know it a shark showed up instantly. Some say Crook had read about the trick in a book, but anyway the boy punched that shark straight in the snout. The shark gave Crook an insulted stare to the count'o 10. Crook though, didn't blink. The boy stared right back into that sharky eye, holding his guard up lika pro. That gave the crew juuuust time enough to hoist Captain Pan» Said .
